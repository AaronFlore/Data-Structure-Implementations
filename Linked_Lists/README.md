Simple linked list and simple immutable linked list implementations. <br /> <br />
A list is a positionally-ordered, completely unrestricted sequence. You can update items at any position, reverse the list, append to the list, lookup an item by position, and many more operations. <br />
The immutable linked list simply returns a new list which is just like the original except with the differences specified by the operation. <br />
The mutable linked list will be directly modified by the methods used on it. <br />
