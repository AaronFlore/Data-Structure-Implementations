A quaternion class for creating quaternion objects and performing various quaternion mathematical operations, such as:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, normalization, inversion, and conjugation.

The quaternion number system extends complex numbers and is usually represented as (a + bi + cj + dk). Quaternions can be utilized to represent the orientation and rotation of an object in space. Practical uses include three-dimensional computer graphics, computer vision, and crystallographic texture analysis.
