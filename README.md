# Data Structure Implementations From Scratch:
<br />
#### Ternary search trees
A Ternary Search Tree (TST) is a specialized tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and searching a set of strings. It combines the advantages of binary search trees and tries, making it particularly useful for tasks like autocomplete and dictionary implementations.
<br />
#### Quaternions
Quaternions are a mathematical concept and a data structure used in 3D computer graphics and physics simulations. They represent rotations in 3D space and are an extension of complex numbers, providing an elegant way to handle 3D orientation transformations.
<br />
#### Stacks
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, making it suitable for various applications, including function call tracking, expression evaluation, and managing undo/redo operations.
<br />
#### Queues
A queue is another essential data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue. Queues are commonly used in scenarios like task scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
<br />
#### Secure Stacks
Secure Stacks are a variant of the traditional stack data structure with added security measures. They are designed to protect against buffer overflow vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of data stored on the stack, making them crucial for secure programming and preventing stack-based attacks.
#### Linked lists 
A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node. Linked lists are flexible and efficient for insertions and deletions, and they come in various forms such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. They are used in various applications, including memory management and building more complex data structures like queues and stacks.
