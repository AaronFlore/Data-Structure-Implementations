 This interface contains the following variety of functions:  <br />
 A recursive mathematical function for a(x, y)<br />
 A decimal to binary function<br />
 Returning the largest integer less than log3(n)<br />
 A x^n power function<br />
 A function to create a power set from a given set and returns a list of multiples from a given set.
 <br /><br />
 Please note: these methods would not ordinarily be written recursively, but I am writing them recursively for practice.
