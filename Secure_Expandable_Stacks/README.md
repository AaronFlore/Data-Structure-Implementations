# Secure Expandable Arrays in Java, C, and C++

The provided code includes implementations of an expandable array-based stack for strings in C++, C, and Java. The purpose of these implementations is to create a secure and reliable data structure for storing and manipulating a stack of strings.

### The C version (stack.c and stack.h)
A module is defined to handle the stack functionality. It ensures fail-fast behavior by crashing with specific error codes or returning response objects to indicate the success or failure of operations.

### The C++ version (stack.cpp) 
Introduces a class that utilizes a raw array of smart pointers for the stack. This implementation takes advantage of C++ features while maintaining security and expandability. It employs exceptions to handle failures promptly and effectively.

### The Java version (Stack.java)
The Java version provides a class for the secure expandable array-based stack of strings. Similar to the C++ implementation, it follows fail-fast principles by throwing exceptions when errors occur.
