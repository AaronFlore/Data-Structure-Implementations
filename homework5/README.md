 This interface contains the following variety of functions:  <br />
 A recursive mathematical function a(x, y), a decimal to binary function, returning the largest integer less than log3(n), and x^n power function. <br />
 These methods would not ordinarily be written recursively, but I am writing them recursively for practice.
 In addition to this recursive functions there are also functions that: <br /> creates a power set from a given set and returns a list of multiples from a given set.
